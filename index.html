I am the Manager of the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/science/research/research-areas/computer-science-and-information-technology/ai-innovation-lab">Artificial Intelligence Innovation Lab</a></li>,
 co-lead of RMIT UAS Research Team (RUSART),
 and a Lecturer in the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/our-education/academic-schools/science/contact/computer-science-and-software-engineering">School of Computing Technologies</a>, in the <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/about/schools-colleges/stem-college">STEM College</a> at RMIT University.
</p>

<p>
I have a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Robotics, and the intersection of AI with real-world systems.
I believe in researching and developing robotic systems to collaborate with and support humans across a wide range of applications.
My research interests include:
    Data Efficient Online Learning (learning on-board autonomous systems in real-time as they operate) through techniques including online deep reinforcement learning;
    Human-Robot Interaction (methods for improving the relationship and trust between humans and robots intended to work with humans);
    Explainable AI in Autonomous Robotics leveraging Augmented Reality;
    Data Efficient optimisation and modelling of real-world systems including metal fatigue and short-term forecasting of wind dynamics;
    Cognitive Robotics (combining symbolic and numeric methods to improve robot decision making);
    and
    Qualitative Modelling and Reasoning (symbolic representations and reasoning of numeric dynamics).
Applications of my research include 
    food waste prevention in macadamia nut harvesting,
    online learning of UAV control, 
    real-time short-term prediction and forecasting of wind dynamics,
    real-time modelling of wind gust and turbulence in aviation domains,
    augmented reality for explaining autonomous robot decisions,
    metal fatigue crack growth modelling in aircraft,
    and
    practical solutions for climate-related challenges.
I have participated in the annual RoboCup competition for autonomous robotics for over 15 years, 
    and currently lead RMIT's team in the Soccer Standard Platform League.

<p>
I am the designer of RMIT's course Programming Autonomous Robots, which is a core course in our Master's of Artificial Intelligence program.
The course launched in 2021, originally in partnership with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/robomaker/">AWS RoboMaker</a>, focuses on practical applications of technologies and algorithms in AI to real-world robotics systems, with a key drive for hands on programming with real robot platforms.
The course currently features a fleet of <a href="https://store.husarion.com/products/rosbot-pro">Husarion ROSBot</a> robots as part of the main application platform. 
The course also features a wide range of application platforms including the Husarion Panther, the Cobot UR5e, the Boston Dynamics Spot, and various UAVs.
</p>

<p>
I am the lead architect for the School of Computing Technologies (SCT) first year Programming Studios, as part of SCT's innovative Bootcamp2Studio first year education experience.
I additionally designed Programming Studio 1 course as part of the Bootcamp2Studio teaching model, which launched in 2021.
Programming Studio 1 showcases to students the end-to-end of software development, where they develop a data-driven fully functional website by the end of their first semester.
It features concepts across user experience design, database concepts, and web programming.
</p>

<p>
    Former courses I have tuaght at RMIT include:
    <ul>
        <li>COSC1076 - Advanced Programming Techniques</li>
