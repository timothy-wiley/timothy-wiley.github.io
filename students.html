                  <p>
                     
                        Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have shown impressive ability in
                     
                        mastering computer games, but notoriously take a long time to learn. As an
                     
                        agent progresses through a game, it will often encounter new states containing
                     
                        previously unencountered game entities, e.g., new enemies. In such situations,
                     
                        DRL agents typically struggle to generalise their prior knowledge to the new
                     
                        entities, owing to differences in state and object representations. In particular,
                     
                        even when new entities behave similarly to previously encountered ones, if they
                     
                        appear to be different then DRL agents can take a long time to adapt.
                     
                  </p>
               
                  <p>
                     
                        Policy transfer learning offers a promising approach for allowing DRL

                        the newly presented states (the target task) and previously encountered ones
                     
                        (the source task) requires guidance from a domain expert. Guidance in the
                     
                        form of externally constructed mapping of state-action pairings, must be continually
                     
                        maintained in response to new game entity encounters.

                        This thesis proposes an alternative approach, where policy transfer is accomplished
                     
                        by leveraging an intermediate state transformation, removing the
                     
                        need for manual mapping. Each entity is mapped to a unique entity ID, and
                     
                        when a new game entity is encountered, a "substitution agent" strives to learn
                     
                        a mapping between the new entity ID and a previously encountered one. For
                     
                        example, if the new entity is a type of enemy, the substitution agent will ideally
                     
                        learn to map the new ID to a previously encountered enemy's ID, rather
                     
                        than, say, the ID of a powerup item. Experimental results show that this
                     
                        approach is effective, allowing for rapid improvement of end-of-episode scores
                     
                        when encountering new entity representations in the game, Infinite Mario.

                        Poor road boundary lanes and detections of road objects have been identified as some of the
                     
                        serious causes of road accidents, in both conventional and autonomous driving. Therefore, it is
                     
                        critical to develop models that could help autonomous vehicles' perception systems while
                     
                        accurately identifying and locating road objects from images and video frames. However, the
                     
                        existing models face a series of challenges due to the highly complex nature of the road traffic
                     
                        scene and the influence of various road objects on the manoeuvring. Most of the existing
                     
                        models cannot simultaneously detect all the major road objects, with some, either detecting
                     
                        lanes or detecting some of the road objects. To address these gaps, the combined road objects
                     
                        and lane detection model was developed using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm.
                     
                        As a first step, a model was developed to detect road objects only and the results were compared
                     
                        with existing studies. Next, another model was developed to detect road lanes based on YOLOv8 capability.
                     
                        Finally, an improved YOLOv8 model was developed to simultaneously
                     
                        detect road objects and lanes. To achieve this, the YOLOv8 model was tuned and optimised
                     
                        using various optimization approaches considering several hyperparameters such as activation
                     
                        functions and regularisation methods. Further, the effect of augmentation was investigated
                     
                        using three techniques; cut-out, rotation and rotation with noise. Also, the effect of the data
                     
                        stream on the performance of the model was investigated based on the obtained
                     
                        hyperparameter. The relevant performance metrics such as precision, F1, and recall were
                     
                        deployed. In addition, mean average precision calculated at an intersection over union (IoU)
                     
                        threshold of 0.5 and 0.95 was reported to assess the model's detection capabilities. The results
                     
                        from this study were further compared with some existing studies such as Feature Pyramid Networks,
                     
                        Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection, Dynamic R-CNN Probabilistic Anchor Assignment with IoU Prediction,
                     
                        Sparse R-CNN and CenterNet to demonstrate the
                     
                        contribution of the model. Further, the performance of the models based on different dataset
                     
                        (Curated data, COCO, and KITTI) showed that curated data outperformed others across all the
                     
                        performance metrics. Notably, curated data has the most promising results with precision,
                     
                        recall and F1 score of 0.68, 0.61, and 0.64, respectively. The success of the curated dataset
                     
                        highlights the significance of tailoring datasets to the specific nuances of the targeted
                     
                        application domain. Finally, the conclusion and recommendations were made based on the
                     
                        findings from the study.

                        Macadamia nut farmers estimate that up to 15% of the macadamia nuts grown each harvest
                     
                        season are left on the ground due to current environmental impacts and harvesting practices.
                     
                        Our research is a first step in addressing and more accurately ascertaining this loss through
                     
                        a vision-based loss estimation system onboard a resource constrained robotic platform.

                        A vision-based approach confers benefits of scalability and cost-reduction over current manual
                     
                        count and estimate practices. However, this approach carries a number of challenges related
                     
                        to data sparsity and vision-based object identification.
                     
                        Due to the rural and often remote
                     
                        location of macadamia nut orchards, collecting sufficient data is inhibitive in terms of cost,
                     
                        time, and logistics. The inherent challenges of vision-based identification are compounded by
                     
                        the camouflage and occlusion of the green in-shell macadamia nuts in a predominantly green background.

                        Our research addresses this challenging vision problem through the use of a surrogate training
                     
                        technique for overcoming data sparsity limitations and a set of generalisable and robust
                     
                        manually-tuned heuristics for use with vision systems.
                     
                        The application of this training approach and our heuristics build
                     
                        on current deep convolution networks to produce improved
                     
                        classification accuracy to a standard normally reserved for simpler problems (e.g., blueberry
                     
                        identification). Our approach was supported by recent advances in prompt-based instance
                     
                        segmentation to perform annotations on a scale which would have otherwise been infeasible
                     
                        given time constraints, thereby enabling the utilisation of larger convolutional neural networks.

                        of modern deep neural networks and artificial intelligence techniques to the Australian

                        The work presents a faster hybrid approach in order to identify different signals from human
                     
                        soccer referee in real-time for the "Visual Referee Challenge" which is introduced in
                     
                        2022 RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL). The main objective of the challenge is
                     
                        to develop a solution that could be applied to the resource constrained humanoid Nao V6
                     
                        robots for better in-game human-robot interaction. Our approach consists of a lightweight
                     
                        machine learning model combined with hand-crafted heuristic method. Further, the performance
                     
                        of the devised approach is contrasted against the 2 sophisticated Convolutional
                     
                        Neural Networks (CNNs) models that are specifically designed for identifying different key points
                     
                        in human body. The result in single image shows that there is significant trade-off
                     
                        between the high accuracy of the CNN models and faster processing time of our approach.
                     
                        However, the analysis on real-time video sequence demonstrates that the proposed hybrid
                     
                        model produce strong performance in much shorter time and is preferred over more powerful
                     
                        and time-consuming CNNs, such that, the devised algorithm achieved 3rd position in

                        In this work, we present a lightweight keypoint-based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
                     
                        approach to the 2023 RoboCup Standard Platform League (SPL) Visual Referee Challenge.
                     
                        The goal of the challenge is to classify 13 different static and dynamic referee gestures during
                     
                        a robotic soccer match. As such, the developed solution must be lightweight and perform well
                     
                        from anywhere on the field. Multiple referees may be present on the field at a time, with the
                     
                        main distinguishing trait of the visual challenge referee being their red gloves.
                     
                        We use the lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pose detector BlazePose Lite to extract the
                     
                        pose key-points. To isolate the referee in the frame, we find the red glove regions using HSV
                     
                        colour segmentation and mask unneeded sections of the image.
                     
                        We then use a lightweight Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to classify the sequence of keypoints.
                     
                        We compare the results of our work to previous solutions developed for the 2022 Visual Referee Challenge.
                     
                        Analysis on real-time testing shows our method achieves strong performance for all gestures
                     
                        on many different locations on the soccer field. Though slower than previous hybrid methods,
                     
                        our solution is easily able to distinguish between the static and dynamic gestures.

                        The alleviation of turbulence for small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAVs) is
                     
                        critical, as it significantly impacts their performance, safety, and mission constraints.
                     
                        Previous wind tunnel experiments highlighted the remarkable abilities of the nankeen kestrel
                     
                        (Falco cenchroides) to windhover steadily in the
                     
                        face of intense turbulence, attributed to its utilization of the multiple degrees of
                     
                        freedom (DoF) present in its wings. The novel design of a bio-inspired aircraft
                     
                        wing inspired by Kestrel birds, consisting of a main body wing and a tail fin
                     
                        with feathers, requires a new design for a servo-level flight controller. Existing
                     
                        controllers, both optimisation-based and learning-based, are insufficient. The
                     
                        bio-inspired design significantly differs from traditional aerodynamic control
                     
                        surfaces, which exhibit unknown nonlinear dynamics that cannot be replicated
                     
                        in simulation, especially in turbulent wind flow conditions. Deep reinforcement
                     
                        learning (DRL) has been used for training stable controllers for non-linear
                     
                        systems, but there is limited investigation into online DRL for stable
                     
                        aircraft flight. We conduct a novel investigation into online DRL design
                     
                        requirements for training a closed-loop control system for a half-wing robotic
                     
                        replica of a Kestrel, to derive an optimal nonlinear policy for effective control
                     
                        and turbulence mitigation for a multi-degree of freedom, multi-objective
                     
                        control system. We consider the performance of DRL algorithms including
                     
                        Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic and Soft-Actor-Critic, and present design
                     
                        requirements for online learning without simulation, including reward function
                     
                        shaping, state space, and action space configurations. We demonstrate the
                     
                        effectiveness of our DRL designs through wind-tunnel experiments, achieving
                     
                        gust rejections in lift by up to 72.6%, and in pitch moment by up to 68.4%.

                        Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been gaining a growing interest for civil and military applications.
                     
                        Utilizing UAV swarms increases flight missions' efficiency, robustness, and reliability, e.g., surveillance or monitoring missions.
                     
                        Fixed-wing UAVs have increased energy efficiency in horizontal flight, longer mission endurance, and better stability,
                     
                        making them more suitable for monitoring large areas than rotary-wing UAVs. Formation flight is an essential part of a UAV swarm.
                     
                        The leader-follower strategy is well-known for its easy applicability, scalability, and flexibility.
                     
                        This work deals with the development and set up of a UAV swarm system for the application of large-area monitoring.
                     
                        It analyses two approaches for utilizing a leader-follower strategy for a fixed-wing UAV swarm: a ground-station-based
                     
                        and a leader-based approach. The ground-station-based approach uses a ground station to calculate the commands for the
                     
                        follower drones and send them to the follower drone. This approach highly relies on good communication.
                     
                        In contrast, the leader-based approach uses a companion computer on the leader drone to calculate commands for the follower
                     
                        drones and send them directly to the follower drone via a mesh network. Extensive simulations using MissionPlanner and
                     
                        flight tests were performed with both approaches. Comparing the approaches in terms of formation accuracy and flight stability
                     
                        provides insights into the advantages of both approaches. The ground-station-based approach reached a final formation
                     
                        accuracy of 67 meters, while the leader-based approach reached a formation accuracy of 53 meters.
                     
                        The leader-based approach proved to be more robust to communication losses and showed higher flight stability.
                     
                        These results show that a leader-based approach is more suitable for application for a large-area monitoring mission.
                     
                        This project sets the foundation for future work in the field of fixed-wing UAV swarms.

                        The main objective and outcome of the research is the development of a functioning digital twin for the prediction of the flow fields
                     
                        around a building exposed to a variety of wind conditions in urban environments.
                     
                        Unmanned aerial vehicles, also referred to as UAVs, air taxis,
                     
                        helicopters and a range of other aerial vehicles provides a promising platform for this technology due to an ever-expanding
                     
                        interest in operating within these obstacle dense and unpredictable environments.
                     
                        Allowing them to manoeuvre accordingly in reaction to onboard sensors comparing simulated data of the buildings flow field,
                     
                        aiding in the prediction of conditions along its flight path.
                     
                        Ability to predict wind conditions would be beneficial for flight path mapping with current studies highlighting the correlation
                     
                        between turbulent flow experienced by aircraft in urban environments and catastrophic crashes.
                     
                        Further potential is seen with the prediction of the shear layers behaviour on top of the building as these changes
                     
                        in velocity and induced turbulent regions have potential for sudden disastrous effects on aircrafts behaviour during taking off,
                     
                        landing and operation within this region.
                     
                        In order to develop a digital twin for the stated application,
                     
                        research on the behaviour of wind flow fields on isolated buildings will be conducted.
                     
                        Known calculations and quantitative values of estimating the position of the points of interest such as stagnation of the flow on the front of the building,
                     
                        separation on top of the build and wake sizes will need to be investigated to accurately place sensor points in simulations to train,
                     
                        test, and apply the predictive abilities of the digital twin.
                     
                        The proposed area of research can be carried out through the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD),
                     
                        Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Machine Learning (ML), High Power Computational (HPC) devices,
                     
                        powerful computational servers, and practical validation testing from recorded data on scale or full-size models.
