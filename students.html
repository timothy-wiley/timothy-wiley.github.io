         Abstract <br />
         Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have shown impressive ability in
         mastering computer games, but notoriously take a long time to learn. As an
         agent progresses through a game, it will often encounter new states containing
         previously unencountered game entities, e.g., new enemies. In such situations,
         DRL agents typically struggle to generalise their prior knowledge to the new
         entities, owing to differences in state and object representations. In particular,
         even when new entities <em>behave</em> similarly to previously encountered ones, if they
         <em>appear</em> to be different then DRL agents can take a long time to adapt. <br />
         Policy transfer learning offers a promising approach for allowing DRL
         agents to adapt their knowledge; however, establishing the connection between
         the newly presented states (the target task) and previously encountered ones
         (the source task) requires guidance from a domain expert. Guidance in the
         form of externally constructed mapping of state-action pairings, must be continually
         maintained in response to new game entity encounters.  <br />
         This thesis proposes an alternative approach, where policy transfer is accomplished
         by leveraging an intermediate state transformation, removing the
         need for manual mapping. Each entity is mapped to a unique entity ID, and
         when a new game entity is encountered, a "substitution agent" strives to learn
         a mapping between the new entity ID and a previously encountered one. For
         example, if the new entity is a type of enemy, the substitution agent will ideally
         learn to map the new ID to a previously encountered enemyâ€™s ID, rather
         than, say, the ID of a powerup item. Experimental results show that this
         approach is effective, allowing for rapid improvement of end-of-episode scores
         when encountering new entity representations in the game, <em>Infinite Mario</em>.
