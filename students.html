                        Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents have shown impressive ability in
                     
                        mastering computer games, but notoriously take a long time to learn. As an
                     
                        agent progresses through a game, it will often encounter new states containing
                     
                        previously unencountered game entities, e.g., new enemies. In such situations,
                     
                        DRL agents typically struggle to generalise their prior knowledge to the new
                     
                        entities, owing to differences in state and object representations. In particular,
                     
                        even when new entities behave similarly to previously encountered ones, if they
                     
                        appear to be different then DRL agents can take a long time to adapt.

                        Policy transfer learning offers a promising approach for allowing DRL
                     
                        agents to adapt their knowledge; however, establishing the connection between
                     
                        the newly presented states (the target task) and previously encountered ones
                     
                        (the source task) requires guidance from a domain expert. Guidance in the
                     
                        form of externally constructed mapping of state-action pairings, must be continually
                     
                        maintained in response to new game entity encounters.

                  <p>
                     
                        This thesis proposes an alternative approach, where policy transfer is accomplished
                     
                        by leveraging an intermediate state transformation, removing the
                     
                        need for manual mapping. Each entity is mapped to a unique entity ID, and
                     
                        when a new game entity is encountered, a "substitution agent" strives to learn
                     
                        a mapping between the new entity ID and a previously encountered one. For
                     
                        example, if the new entity is a type of enemy, the substitution agent will ideally
                     
                        learn to map the new ID to a previously encountered enemy's ID, rather
                     
                        than, say, the ID of a powerup item. Experimental results show that this
                     
                        approach is effective, allowing for rapid improvement of end-of-episode scores
                     
                        when encountering new entity representations in the game, Infinite Mario.

                        Poor road boundary lanes and detections of road objects have been identified as some of the
                     
                        serious causes of road accidents, in both conventional and autonomous driving. Therefore, it is
                     
                        critical to develop models that could help autonomous vehicles' perception systems while
                     
                        accurately identifying and locating road objects from images and video frames. However, the
                     
                        existing models face a series of challenges due to the highly complex nature of the road traffic
                     
                        scene and the influence of various road objects on the manoeuvring. Most of the existing
                     
                        models cannot simultaneously detect all the major road objects, with some, either detecting
                     
                        lanes or detecting some of the road objects. To address these gaps, the combined road objects
                     
                        and lane detection model was developed using the You Only Look Once (YOLO) algorithm.
                     
                        As a first step, a model was developed to detect road objects only and the results were compared
                     
                        with existing studies. Next, another model was developed to detect road lanes based on YOLOv8 capability.
                     
                        Finally, an improved YOLOv8 model was developed to simultaneously
                     
                        detect road objects and lanes. To achieve this, the YOLOv8 model was tuned and optimised
                     
                        using various optimization approaches considering several hyperparameters such as activation
                     
                        functions and regularisation methods. Further, the effect of augmentation was investigated
                     
                        using three techniques; cut-out, rotation and rotation with noise. Also, the effect of the data
                     
                        stream on the performance of the model was investigated based on the obtained
                     
                        hyperparameter. The relevant performance metrics such as precision, F1, and recall were
                     
                        deployed. In addition, mean average precision calculated at an intersection over union (IoU)
                     
                        threshold of 0.5 and 0.95 was reported to assess the model's detection capabilities. The results
                     
                        from this study were further compared with some existing studies such as Feature Pyramid Networks,
                     
                        Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection, Dynamic R-CNN Probabilistic Anchor Assignment with IoU Prediction,
                     
                        Sparse R-CNN and CenterNet to demonstrate the
                     
                        contribution of the model. Further, the performance of the models based on different dataset
                     
                        (Curated data, COCO, and KITTI) showed that curated data outperformed others across all the
                     
                        performance metrics. Notably, curated data has the most promising results with precision,
                     
                        recall and F1 score of 0.68, 0.61, and 0.64, respectively. The success of the curated dataset
                     
                        highlights the significance of tailoring datasets to the specific nuances of the targeted
                     
                        application domain. Finally, the conclusion and recommendations were made based on the
                     
                        findings from the study.

                        The main objective and outcome of the research is the development of a functioning digital twin for the prediction of the flow fields
                     
                        around a building exposed to a variety of wind conditions in urban environments.
                     
                        Unmanned aerial vehicles, also referred to as UAVs, air taxis,
                     
                        helicopters and a range of other aerial vehicles provides a promising platform for this technology due to an ever-expanding
                     
                        interest in operating within these obstacle dense and unpredictable environments.
                     
                        Allowing them to manoeuvre accordingly in reaction to onboard sensors comparing simulated data of the buildings flow field,
                     
                        aiding in the prediction of conditions along its flight path.
                     
                        Ability to predict wind conditions would be beneficial for flight path mapping with current studies highlighting the correlation
                     
                        between turbulent flow experienced by aircraft in urban environments and catastrophic crashes.
                     
                        Further potential is seen with the prediction of the shear layers behaviour on top of the building as these changes
                     
                        in velocity and induced turbulent regions have potential for sudden disastrous effects on aircrafts behaviour during taking off,
                     
                        landing and operation within this region.
                     
                        In order to develop a digital twin for the stated application,
                     
                        research on the behaviour of wind flow fields on isolated buildings will be conducted.
                     
                        Known calculations and quantitative values of estimating the position of the points of interest such as stagnation of the flow on the front of the building,
                     
                        separation on top of the build and wake sizes will need to be investigated to accurately place sensor points in simulations to train,
                     
                        test, and apply the predictive abilities of the digital twin.
                     
                        The proposed area of research can be carried out through the use of Computer Aided Design (CAD),
                     
                        Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Machine Learning (ML), High Power Computational (HPC) devices,
                     
                        powerful computational servers, and practical validation testing from recorded data on scale or full-size models.
